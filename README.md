# True Third-Person Camera

A third-person camera for Baldur's Gate 3. One button switches to an over-the-shoulder view,
and pressing it again puts the camera back.

The pitch changes on its own between the two views: horizontal in the close view, and a
diagonal angle in the far view. During combat there is a dynamic action camera that
takes over when you cast a spell or when it is the enemy's turn.

Character size is tracked while you play and the camera offsets are adjusted to it
automatically, so wild shape forms and summons are handled as well.

The MCM menu is split into categories and every setting can be changed in real time. It also
has a preset picker with built-in camera setups, and presets made by other players can be
imported too.

This mod started as a fork of Native Camera Tweaks by Ershin, and a lot of that camera hook
code is still in use here, so thanks for all the hard work.

## Contents

The mod has two parts and you need both of them.

- `src/` is the native DLL. It hooks into the game's camera code.
- `script-extender/` is a Script Extender mod that gets packed into a .pak. It tells the DLL
  things it can't work out on its own, like wild shape forms, combat state and MCM settings.

The folders under `script-extender/Data/Mods/` are nested pretty deep, but that's just how BG3
wants them inside a .pak.

## Building

Visual Studio 2022 with C++ support, CMake 3.21+, and vcpkg with `VCPKG_ROOT` set.

```powershell
cmake --preset REL -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The DLL lands in `build/Release/`. Copy it into `Baldurs Gate 3/bin/NativeMods/`.

## Packing the .pak

divine.exe comes from [LSLib](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib):

```powershell
divine.exe --action create-package --source script-extender\Data --destination TrueThirdPersonCamera.pak --game bg3
```

Install the .pak with BG3 Mod Manager afterwards. The DLL alone won't do anything on its own.
